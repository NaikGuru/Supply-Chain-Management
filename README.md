📊 AtliQ Mart – OTIF Delivery Performance Dashboard

Supply Chain Analytics | Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling

⭐ Project Overview

AtliQ Mart is a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India and currently operating in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. The company plans to expand into metro/tier-1 cities but is currently facing challenges due to poor delivery performance.

Several key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to issues with:

❌ Late deliveries

❌ Incomplete deliveries

This has directly affected the On-Time, In-Full, and OTIF service levels.

To solve this, the Supply Chain Analytics team wants a dashboard that tracks OT, IF, and OTIF performance daily, enabling the company to take corrective actions quickly.

As the newly joined Data Analyst, your role is to build this analytics solution.

🎯 Business Objectives

The project aims to:

✔ Measure and track On-Time Delivery (OT%)

✔ Measure In-Full Delivery (IF%)

✔ Track combined On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)

✔ Provide daily monitoring against target service levels

✔ Identify patterns and insights to improve customer service

📁 Data Source

All data, business requirement documents, stakeholder meeting comics, and metric definitions are from:
